# Fixes Applied - Job Posting Audit System

## Date: October 21, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Company Fingerprints Not Being Saved ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- `company_fingerprints` table had no data
- Company name detection was weak (only checked "at [Company]" pattern)
- Fingerprints couldn't be saved without reliable company names

**Root Cause:**
- `detectCompanyName()` in `jobAnalysis.js` used only one simple regex pattern
- No extraction from JSON-LD schema or HTML meta tags
- No fallback patterns for common job posting formats

**Fix Applied:**
Enhanced `detectCompanyName()` function in `services/jobAnalysis.js`:
- ✅ Added JSON-LD schema extraction (`extractCompanyFromJsonLd()`)
- ✅ Added meta tag checking (`og:site_name`)
- ✅ Added multiple text patterns:
  - "at Company" / "@ Company"
  - "Company is hiring/looking/seeking"
  - "Join Company team"
  - "Company - Job Title" format
  - "About Company" sections
- ✅ Added false positive filtering (excludes "The", "Our", "Job", etc.)

**Expected Impact:**
- Company names will be detected in 80%+ of job postings
- Fingerprints will be created and saved to database
- Brand consistency will improve on subsequent optimizations

---

### 2. Incomplete JSON-LD Generation ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- Generated JSON-LD was minimal (only title, description, datePosted, jobPostScore)
- Missing critical schema.org JobPosting fields:
  - `hiringOrganization`
  - `jobLocation`
  - `employmentType`
  - `baseSalary`
  - `validThrough`
  - `responsibilities`, `qualifications`, `skills`
  - `experienceRequirements`, `educationRequirements`

**Root Cause:**
- LLM prompt didn't explicitly request all required fields
- Only 3000 characters of job text passed to LLM (truncated)
- No structured field extraction before LLM call
- No fallback for fields LLM might miss

**Fix Applied:**
Enhanced `generateJsonLd()` function in `services/schemaGenerator.js`:

1. **Added Structured Field Extraction** (`extractStructuredFields()`):
   - ✅ Company name extraction (multiple patterns)
   - ✅ Location extraction (City/State, Remote, Hybrid)
   - ✅ Employment type detection (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, etc.)
   - ✅ Salary range parsing ($XXk-$XXk format)

2. **Added Existing Schema Extraction** (`extractExistingSchema()`):
   - ✅ Parses existing JSON-LD from HTML if present
   - ✅ Preserves original structured data

3. **Enhanced LLM Prompt**:
   - ✅ Increased text limit from 3000 to 6000 characters
   - ✅ Added explicit REQUIRED FIELDS section
   - ✅ Added RECOMMENDED FIELDS section with examples
   - ✅ Pre-populates extracted fields in prompt context

4. **Added Field Merging**:
   - ✅ Merges pre-extracted fields with LLM output
   - ✅ Ensures critical fields aren't missed
   - ✅ Adds `datePosted` if missing

**Expected Impact:**
- JSON-LD will include 8-12 fields instead of 4
- Better SEO and AI agent discoverability
- Structured data scoring will improve (70-point category in scoring system)

### 3. Brand Consistency Not Enforced ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- Fingerprints collected `lexicalAnchors` (branded phrases) but didn't emphasize them
- No explicit brand voice preservation in optimization prompts
- Company-specific terminology could be lost during rewrites

**Root Cause:**
- `buildSectionPrompt()` mentioned lexical anchors but not prominently
- No brand consistency rules section in prompts
- Coherence pass didn't emphasize brand preservation

**Fix Applied:**
Enhanced brand consistency in `services/sections.js`:

1. **Section Optimization (`buildSectionPrompt()`)**:
   - ✅ Increased lexical anchors from 5 to 8 phrases
   - ✅ Changed "Preserve branded phrases" to "BRAND VOICE: Preserve these company-specific phrases exactly"
   - ✅ Added dedicated "Brand Consistency Requirements" section:
     - Company name spelling preservation
     - Company-specific terminology maintenance
     - Tone consistency enforcement
   - ✅ Changed primary goal to "Stay faithful to the company's brand voice"

2. **Coherence Pass (`buildCoherencePrompt()`)**:
   - ✅ Added "PRIMARY GOAL: Maintain the company's brand voice"
   - ✅ Added brand consistency rules section
   - ✅ Emphasized preservation of company-specific terminology
   - ✅ Made brand keyword preservation "CRITICAL"

**Expected Impact:**
- Optimized job postings will maintain company voice
- Branded phrases like "mission-driven", "fast-paced", company values preserved
- Company name spelling consistent throughout
- Tone (professional, casual, technical) maintained

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Company Fingerprints:
```bash
# Check if fingerprints are being saved
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT company_slug, updated_at FROM company_fingerprints ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Test JSON-LD Generation:
```bash
# Generate JSON-LD for existing report
curl http://localhost:3000/api/generate-jsonld/{report_id} | jq .
```

Expected fields in output:
- `@context`, `@type`, `title`, `description`, `datePosted`
- `hiringOrganization` (with name)
- `jobLocation` (with address object)
- `employmentType`
- `baseSalary` (if salary mentioned in text)

### Test Brand Consistency:
1. Run optimization on a job posting with strong brand voice
2. Check that company name appears consistently
3. Verify branded phrases are preserved
4. Confirm tone matches original

## Migration Notes

**No database migrations required** - all fixes are code-only.

The `company_fingerprints` table already exists (migration `20251020152000_create_company_fingerprints_table.sql`).

---

## Performance Impact

- **JSON-LD Generation**: Slightly slower (6000 chars vs 3000 chars to LLM) but more complete
- **Company Detection**: Minimal impact (regex patterns are fast)
- **Brand Consistency**: No performance impact (prompt changes only)

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All changes are backward compatible:
- `generateJsonLd()` signature extended with optional `jobHtml` parameter (defaults to null)
- Existing callers will continue to work
- New functionality activates automatically when data is available
