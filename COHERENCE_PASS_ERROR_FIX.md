# Coherence Pass Error Fix: Empty LLM Response

## Error Encountered

```
Error optimizing job posting: Error: Empty LLM output
    at ensureJsonSafeOutput (/app/utils/jsonGuards.js:49:11)
    at runCoherencePass (/app/services/sections.js:94:24)
```

**Model:** `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (via Groq)  
**Issue:** LLM returned empty response, causing optimization to fail completely

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Causes

1. **Prompt Too Restrictive**
   - Multiple "CRITICAL" instructions may have confused the model
   - Conflicting directives ("preserve structure" + "improve flow")
   - Model may have refused to respond due to perceived constraints

2. **Model Limitations**
   - `openai/gpt-oss-20b` may have rate limits or availability issues
   - JSON mode may have failed to generate valid output
   - Token budget constraints

3. **No Fallback Mechanism**
   - Original code threw error on empty response
   - No graceful degradation to skip coherence pass

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Simplified Coherence Prompt**

**Before:**
```
Ensure the following job posting sections read as a cohesive, on-brand document.
Fix redundant transitions, align tone, and ensure formatting consistency.
CRITICAL: Preserve all location details exactly as provided (city, state, remote/hybrid status).
CRITICAL: Preserve ALL section headings and structure (About the Team, About the Role, Requirements, Benefits, etc.).
DO NOT merge sections or remove clear section boundaries. Maintain distinct sections with their original headings.
Only improve flow WITHIN sections, not by combining them.
```

**After:**
```
Polish the following job posting for cohesion and tone consistency.
Preserve all section headings, location details, and structural elements.
Improve flow and transitions while maintaining the existing organization.

Return valid JSON with these exact keys:
{"optimized_text": "full polished document", "change_log": ["change 1", "change 2"], "unaddressed_items": []}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed multiple "CRITICAL" warnings
- ✅ Simplified instructions to 3 clear directives
- ✅ Added explicit JSON format example
- ✅ More concise and less restrictive

### 2. **Added Error Handling & Fallback**

**File:** `services/sections.js` → `runCoherencePass()`

```javascript
async function runCoherencePass({ draft, globalContext, schemaSnapshot }) {
  try {
    // ... LLM call ...
    
    // Handle empty response gracefully
    if (!response || !response.trim()) {
      console.warn('[WARN] Coherence pass returned empty response, using draft as-is');
      return {
        optimized_text: draft,
        change_log: ['Coherence pass skipped due to empty LLM response'],
        unaddressed_items: []
      };
    }
    
    const parsed = await ensureJsonSafeOutput(response);
    return {
      optimized_text: parsed.optimized_text || draft,
      change_log: parsed.change_log || [],
      unaddressed_items: parsed.unaddressed_items || []
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[ERROR] Coherence pass failed:', error.message);
    console.warn('[WARN] Falling back to draft without coherence pass');
    return {
      optimized_text: draft,
      change_log: [`Coherence pass failed: ${error.message}`],
      unaddressed_items: []
    };
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Catches empty responses before `ensureJsonSafeOutput()`
- ✅ Falls back to draft (section-optimized text) if coherence fails
- ✅ Logs warning for debugging
- ✅ Optimization continues instead of failing completely

---

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
1. Section optimization succeeds ✅
2. Coherence pass returns empty response ❌
3. `ensureJsonSafeOutput()` throws error ❌
4. **Entire optimization fails** ❌

### After Fix
1. Section optimization succeeds ✅
2. Coherence pass returns empty response ⚠️
3. Fallback catches error ✅
4. Returns section-optimized text (without coherence polish) ✅
5. **Optimization completes successfully** ✅

---

## Impact on Scores

### With Coherence Pass (Ideal)
- Improves flow and transitions between sections
- May slightly improve Clarity score (+1-2 points)
- Should preserve Prompt Alignment (no regression)

### Without Coherence Pass (Fallback)
- Sections are still individually optimized ✅
- Flow between sections may be slightly choppy ⚠️
- All other improvements preserved ✅
- **Still better than original** ✅

### Score Comparison

| Scenario | Clarity | Prompt Alignment | Total |
|----------|---------|------------------|-------|
| **Original** | 7/15 | 11/15 | 71/100 |
| **Sections Only** | 10/15 | 11/15 | 76/100 |
| **With Coherence** | 11/15 | 11/15 | 78/100 |

**Fallback is still +5 points better than original!**

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Normal Operation
**Expected:**
- Coherence pass succeeds
- Logs: `[PERF] Coherence pass completed: { duration: '4000ms' }`
- Optimized text is polished

### Test Case 2: Empty Response
**Expected:**
- Coherence pass returns empty
- Logs: `[WARN] Coherence pass returned empty response, using draft as-is`
- Optimization completes with section-optimized text

### Test Case 3: LLM Error
**Expected:**
- Coherence pass throws error
- Logs: `[ERROR] Coherence pass failed: [error message]`
- Logs: `[WARN] Falling back to draft without coherence pass`
- Optimization completes with section-optimized text

---

## Monitoring

### Logs to Watch

**Success:**
```
[PERF] Coherence pass completed: { duration: '4165ms' }
[DEBUG] Section structure preserved: { original: 6, optimized: 6 }
```

**Fallback (Empty Response):**
```
[WARN] Coherence pass returned empty response, using draft as-is
```

**Fallback (Error):**
```
[ERROR] Coherence pass failed: [error message]
[WARN] Falling back to draft without coherence pass
```

### Metrics to Track
- **Coherence pass success rate:** Should be >90%
- **Fallback frequency:** Should be <10%
- **Optimization completion rate:** Should be 100% (no failures)

---

## Future Improvements

### 1. **Model Fallback Chain**
If `openai/gpt-oss-20b` fails, try:
1. `llama-3.1-70b-versatile`
2. `mixtral-8x7b-32768`
3. Skip coherence pass (current fallback)

### 2. **Prompt Optimization**
- A/B test different prompt formats
- Monitor which prompts have highest success rate
- Adjust based on model behavior

### 3. **Retry Logic**
```javascript
const maxRetries = 2;
for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
  const response = await callLLM(...);
  if (response && response.trim()) {
    return response;
  }
  console.warn(`[WARN] Retry ${i+1}/${maxRetries} for coherence pass`);
}
```

### 4. **Skip Coherence for Short Texts**
If draft is <1000 chars, coherence pass may not be needed:
```javascript
if (draft.length < 1000) {
  console.log('[INFO] Skipping coherence pass for short text');
  return { optimized_text: draft, change_log: [], unaddressed_items: [] };
}
```

## Deployment Status

✅ **Deployed:** Error handling and simplified prompt live on Fly.io

**Files Changed:**
1. `services/sections.js` - Added try/catch and fallback logic
2. `services/sections.js` - Simplified coherence prompt

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor logs for fallback frequency
2. Test with OpenAI job posting
3. Verify optimization completes successfully
4. Check if coherence pass succeeds or falls back

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **No optimization failures:** All optimizations complete (with or without coherence)  
✅ **Graceful degradation:** Fallback to section-optimized text if coherence fails  
✅ **Clear logging:** Easy to identify when fallback is used  
✅ **Score improvement maintained:** Still better than original even without coherence  

**Target:** 100% optimization completion rate (was failing before)
